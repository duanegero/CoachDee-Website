            <p class="about-section">I'm Duane Gero, one of the Technical Directors of Basketball at the Community Y. With a passion for the game and a dedication to fostering young talent, I've been coaching the U12 boys' team, the Panthers, for the past decade. Under my guidance, the Panthers have secured numerous city and provincial championships, a testament to our hard work and team spirit.</p>
            <p class="about-section">My journey in basketball began at the age of 8 when I started playing for the Panthers. Growing up, I had the privilege of playing for some of the most respected coaches in the city. In high school, I played for three local schools: Halifax Grammar School, St. Pat's High, and Citadel High School. I further honed my skills during a brief stint at Concordia University. These experiences have shaped my approach to coaching, emphasizing both skill development and the importance of teamwork.</p>
            <p class="about-section">At the Community Y, I train boys and girls aged 8-16, focusing on essential basketball skills. My coaching covers offensive skills, defensive principles, how to play the game, footwork, and other basics. In addition to on-court coaching, I also mentor young coaches, sharing my knowledge and passion for the game to help them grow and succeed.</p>
            <p class="about-section">I believe in the power of basketball to build character, teach life skills, and create lasting friendships. Whether you're a player looking to improve your game or a coach seeking guidance, I'm here to support your journey in basketball. Let's work together to achieve greatness on and off the court!</p>
            <p class="about-section">Feel free to reach out to me for any coaching needs or basketball inquiries. Go Panthers!</p>
